Lesson 3: Understanding Cascading Style Sheets

This lesson explained how to use style sheets to customize the appearance of your HTML pages. It is helpful to reference an external style sheet with rules that will apply to all specified elements in that page. However, another option is to include the style rules within an HTML page (within the head tag) but those rules can only be applied to that page. 

There are lots of ways to customize your page using style properties, which generally fall into two major categories; layout properties and formatting properties. Both are used to visually customize the elements on the page. You can also use style classes to specify certain rules to different selectors (h1, p, a, etc.) if you want more control over specific visual effects on different elements under the same category. Style IDs are similar to style classes, but can only be used once within a page and use the # to distinguish them.

What You'll Learn in the Lesson:
How to create a basic style sheet
    Style sheet- grouping of formatting instructions that control the appearance of several HTML pages at once
    
    CSS- Cascading Style Sheets (can be stored directly in HTML page or seperate style sheet file)
    
    Style Rule- formatting instruction that can be applied to an element on a web page 
    
    Internal Style Sheet- placed directly within a web page
    
    External Style Sheet- seperate document that is linked to a web page via a special tag
    
    Hierarchy- most specific styles override more general styles
    
    Element- a piece of information (content) in a web page
    
    Selector- used to identify tags on a page to which you apply styles (body, h1, p, img, a, etc)

    Style Rules- describe how content within that tag should appear

    Pt- point (72 points in an inch)

    Fixed vs relative (rem and em) lenghts 

    Semicolor (;) used to seperate style rules from each other

    to link style sheet to HTML include <link> in <head>:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

    Style Properties-
        Layout Properties: properties that affect the posititioning of elements on a webpage (margins, padding, alignment)
            Display property- describes how an element is displayed with respect to other elements (relative positioning)
                1. block- the element is displayed on a new line
                2. list-item- element is displayed on new line with a bullet
                3. inline- element displayed inline with current paragraph
                4. inline-block- element is displayed as block level element inline with surrounding block elements
                5. none- element is not displayed; hidden

                display:block;

        Formatting Properties: properties that affect the visual display of elements in a website (font type, size, and color)
            Border- visible boundary around an element with box
                border-width, border-color, border-style, border-left, border-right, border-top, border-bottom, border
                solid, double, dashed, dotted, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden
                border-top-left-radius, border-bottom-right-radius, etc.
            Color-
                background-color
                color- hexadecimal, rgb
            Text alignment (only applies to the contents of block-level element)
            Font-
                font-family (use quotes if the typeface has multiple words)
                font-size
                font-style (normal, italic)
                font-weight (normal, lighter, bold, bolder)
            text-decoration- can turn off link underlining (none); underline, overline, line-through
            text-align- aligns left right, center, or justify
            padding- adds space around element


How to use style classes
    Style Class- custom set of formatting specifications that can be applied to any element in a web page
        Style Property- specific style that you can assign a value (color, font-size, etc.)
        Example: h1{font: 36 pt Coutier;}
            h1- selector
            font- style property
            36 pt courier- value
    To choose between two style classes use CLASS attribute
        Ex: <h1 class="silly"> Heading 1 </h1>
            h1.silly {font:36 pt comic sans;}
            h1.serious {font: 36py arial;}
    When referencing a style class, specify the class name in the class attribute of an element

How to use style IDs
    Style ID- custom set of formatting specifications that can be applied to only one element in a web page
        use IDS across set of pages but only once within each page
        Ex: <p id="title"> Title Goes Here </p>
            p#title {font: 24pt Verdana}

How to construct internal style sheets and inline styles
    Enclose style sheet between <style> and </style>
    Must appear in the <head>
    <span> and </span> dummy tags specify a range of content to apply style to
    <div> forces a line break, <span? doesn't>
    Inline style Ex: 
        <p style="color: green;">
        This text is green but <span style="color:red;"> this text is red.</span>
