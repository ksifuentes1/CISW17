    <p> Hi! My name is Karla. I recently graduated from the University 
        of Southern California but I am back as a student taking this 
        course. I've always wanted to learn how to code, but never had time.
        This year, my new year's resolution was to learn a new skill, so this class was perfect. 
        I hope to use the skills from this class in my current marketing job
        and add to my professional tools to advance in my career :)</p>

        <p> I have a few hobbies on the side that keep me sane. I like reading, dancing, crocheting, 
            puzzles, and now coding. I enjoy swimming and warm weather. I am taking this course because
            I love to learn and I hope the skills I learn here could help me find a more flexible job 
            that I can do anywhere in the world.
