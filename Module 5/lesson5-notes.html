    <h2> Lesson 9: Working with Margins, Padding, Alignment, and Floating</h2>
    <p> This lesson covered how to use margins, padding, and float to lay out the elements on your page. The margin specifies the space around the element, while the padding property controls the space within that element. To control how these elements line up, we can use the text-align and vertical-align properties to keep everything aligned.</p>
    <p> For more flexibility, you can also use the float property, which allows the elements to move around based on where other elements lie. By using this property you can ensure that other elements wrap around this element. However, if you don't want certain elements to wrap around a particular side, you can use the clear property. </p>
    
    <h3>What You'll Learn in this Lesson</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>How to add margins around elements</li>
        <li>How to add padding within elements</li>
        <li>How to keep everything aligned</li>
        <li>How to use the float property</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Lesson 10: Understanding the CSS Box Model and Positioning</h2>
    <p> This lesson taught us the CSS box model as a way to visualize the space around and within an element. <strong>The three componenets that go into how an element is layed out are the margin, border, and padding (and content). Whether you are defining the space around the element (margin), the outer edge around the element (border), or the area around the content, but within the border (padding), it is important to know how the Box Model affects the space each component takes up so as to plan the way your content is layed out. </strong>Especially because the size of each will add up to cover the total width and height of the elements.</p>
    <p>After learning how we calculate the space of our elements, we learned about the z-index to position those elements. When your elements have absolute positioning, meaning you have control over the exact position of an element (and not relative to other objects), you can define the z-index to place them along the z-axis of your page. A lower z-index will sit below the elements of a higher z-index. Then, the lesson covered how to control the flow of text, whether it floats around an element, clears the flow of text after the element, or overflows past the element when there is not enough room. Overall, the tools we learned in this lesson contribute to the box of knowledge we are building to control our web content.</p>

    <h3>What You'll Learn in this Lesson</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>How to conceptualize the CSS box model</li>
        <li>How to change the box model the browser uses</li>
        <li>How to position your elements</li>
        <li>How to control the way elements stack up</li>
        <li>How to manage the flow of text</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Lesson 11: Using CSS to Do More with Lists, Text, and Navigation</h2>
    <p> This lesson taught us, first, how the box model affects lists and list elements. Just like any other elements, the list and the individual list elements can be adjusted by padding, margins, and borders. There are ways to move the list decoration (bullets) inside the list item box, keep them outside (default), replace the bullet with another image, and even remove the list decoration altogether. By using lists, we also learned how to create an image map to link certain parts of an image to specific lists. Later, these list properties came in handy when we learned how to apply these to horizontal and vertical navigation. </p>
    <p>With a few CSS tricks, we learned how to customize the list items using the "nav" tag and specifying some properties such as width, float, margins, etc. We learned how to build a basic horizontal navigation for primary navigation and a vertical navigation for secondary navigation. Then, how to nest list elements so that you can direct users to pages within the main pages of your site and so that the navigation is intuitive. </p>
