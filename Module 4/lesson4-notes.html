    <h2>Lesson 6: Working with Fonts, Text Blocks, Lists</h2>
    <!-- two paragpah summary -->
    <p>This lesson taught us how to further enrich the look of our websites, building on concepts we have been learning for the last few weeks. For example, we learned how to use the "strong" and "em" tags for bold and italic text, which are recommended for use instead of the "b" or "i" tags since these don't provide any semantic meaning for the browser's interpretation. We also learned some special tags for superscript and subscript text, and a few special characters. Another important concept for customizing your page included changing the font. Using the font-family style rule, which can be included in the style rules portion of the page or inline with the tag (or referenced in a seperate style sheet), you can specify several fonts in order so the browser has several options to choose from when the first font is not available. </p>
    <p>Once your text is on the page, you may also want to visually organize it by aligning the text to the left, right, or center (or justify). You can do this to any block-level element by either referencing a seperate style sheet, using the style rules at the top of your html document, or inline with the tag. For more flexibility, you can use attributes within the tag to specify the look for certain elements. Another way to visually format your page is to use lists and tables. Lists can be nested for even more organization, while tables can provide rich structure to data you want to display. You can even use CSS to customize the look of your table, although it is not recommended to use tables to visually lay out your page if it is not data. You should use CSS for visual layout, such as CSS columns for seperating content in an easy to read format. </p>

    <h2>Lesson 7:</h2>
    <!-- two paragpah summary -->
    <p>There are several ways to refer people to other content on the web, whether it is your own or an external site. We learned how to use the "a" tag to anchor to pages within our personal directory, external sites, and even to pdfs and documents. Furthermore, we learned boolean attributes that force the browser to execute certain commands, such as downloading a document. There are also ways to link to an email address, with capabilities to specify the subject, body, and cc or bcc. A very useful tool is the target=_blank component, which forces the browser to open that link in a new tab. </p>
    <p>After learning how to create functional links on a page, we learned how to style them so they look and act a special way. For example, using pseudo classes helps us specify how the link will look when certain actions are taken, like hovering, clicking, and what the link looks like after it has been visited. There are also ways to add descriptions to links to provide more meaning without taking up space on the page. Finally, the lesson concluded with best practices for using links, such as making sure your links are apparent and consistent as well as leveraging icons and images to attract users to your links. </p>

    <h2>Lesson 8:</h2>
    <!-- two paragpah summary -->
    <p>This lengthy lesson covered how to further customize your text with colors, use images, and embed multimedia files on your website. We learned the importance of using few colors, not only for cohesiveness and simplicity, but also to reduce the loading time of your page. We learned a few css styles to create unique colors via the hexadecimal or rgba values. However, colors are not the only way to enrich your pages. Images and multimedia files provide more information and diversify your page beyond simple text.  </p>
    <p>Because images, video, and audio take up more space, it is important to specify as much as possible the area this media will take up. The lesson taught us to consider cropping, resizing and reducing the number of colors in an image to reduce loading times and support a seamless user experiene. You can also use thumbnails to preview some image without taking up so much space. The text emphasized using the alt attribute to describe the image for accessiblity purposes. Similarly, the video and source elements allow you to embed a media player and play videos on your webpage. The source element allows you to refer to several media files in case your browser doesn't support the one you specified. Audio works in the same way. By using the audio element, you can render your audio via a mediaplayer embedded in your browser. You can specify a few attributes such as preload and loop to customize how your audio acts, although some practices, such as autoplay, are not recommmended. </p>
