    <h1 class="w3-center w3-container w3-khaki">Using JavaScript Variables, Strings, and Arrays</h1>
<main>
    <p class="w3-container w3-light-green">Summary:</p>
    <ul>
    <p>This lesson dove deeper into JavaScript, explaining how variables, functions, methods, strings, arrays, and objects work. First, we learned how to declare and use variables, assigning values to them, and how JavaScript reads the values in a prescribed order of operations. Within a variable, you can have string objects which are groups of characters or text surrounded by quotation marks. There are a few handy tools to work with strings, such as concatenating, calculating the length of a string or converting strings to all caps. Also, we learned how to find specific items in a string by using indexOf method. </p>
    <p>Besides variables and strings, this lesson covered arrays, which are groups of items (numeric or not) treated as a single unit. An array can also include string of text which can be sorted, split, joined, or counted. For grouping various JavaScript statements, we were taught how to define functions with the correct syntax and then how to call the function so that it executes. Then, we learned more about objects, which can store several properties, compared to a variable that can only store one piece of information. This came in handy when we learned how to develop a contact card with a person’s name, email, address, and phone number.</p>
    <p>Finally, the lesson covered a few numerical capabilities by using the Math object’s methods. For example, we can round numbers and generate random numbers for a variety of purposes. JavaScript also has a Date object that lets us call and view specific dates and times, across several time zones. All are very useful and necessary tools to know when working with JavaScript. </p>

    <p class="w3-container w3-light-green">What You'll Learn in This Lesson</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="w3-container w3-lime">How to name, declare, and assign variables</li>
            <ul class="w3-ul w3-border">
            <li>Variable names can include letters of the alphabet, both upper- and lowercase. They can also include the digits 0–9 and the underscore (_) character.</li>
            <li>Variable names cannot include spaces or any other punctuation characters.</li>
            <li>The first character of the variable name must be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
            <li>Variable names are case sensitive; for example, <code>totalnum</code>, <code>Totalnum</code>, and <code>TotalNum</code> are interpreted as separate variable names.</li>
            <li>There is no official limit on the length of a variable name, but it must fit on one line. Frankly, if your variable names are longer than that—or even longer than 25 or so characters, you might consider a different naming convention.</li>
            </ul>
        <li class="w3-container w3-lime">How to choose whether to use local or global variables</li>
            <ul class="w3-ul w3-border">
                <li>Defining Global and Local Variables</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Global Variables have the entire script (and other scripits in the same HTML) and can be used anywhere, even within functions.</li>
                    <li>Local Variables have a single function as their scope and can only be used within the function they are created in.</li>
                </ul> 
                <li>Assigning Value to Variables</li>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the = sign to assign a value to a variable like so: <code>var lines = 40;</code></li>
                </ul>
                <li>How to Increment and Decrement Variables</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the += sign to add a number from a variable like so: <code>lines +=1;</code> or use ++ to add 1 to the variable like so: <code>lines++;</code> </li>
                    <li>Use the -= sign to subtract a number from a variable like so: <code>lines -=1;</code> or use -- to subtract 1 to the variable like so: <code>lines--;</code> </li></li>
                </ul>
                <li>JavaScript Operators:</li>
